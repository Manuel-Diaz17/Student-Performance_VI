        <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            This project utilizes the "Student Performance" dataset from the 
            <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. 
            The dataset contains information on 649 students from two Portuguese secondary schools, capturing their demographic, academic, and behavioural characteristics. 
            There are 33 features, including attributes such as family status, study time, free time, past failures, and final grades.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to visualize and analyse how various factors impact student performance. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the distribution of final grades across students.</li>
            <li>Explore the relationship between parental education levels and student outcomes.</li>
            <li>Identify potential patterns in demographic, academic, and behavioural data that influence student performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These insights can help educators and teachers design better interventions to improve educational performance.
